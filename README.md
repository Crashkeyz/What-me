## Installation

### M5burner

1. Connect your device to your computer.
2. Download M5burner in UIFLOW FIRMWARE BURNING TOOL section: [M5Stack Download Center](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/download)
3. Place the necessary SD file content at the root of SD card. (This is needed to access all the files of the project). ⚠️ the SD-Card-Folder files now need to be in a folder named evil at root of the sd card ⚠️
4. Type "evil-" in search bar and check for the device you have.
5. Click download and flash.

### Compile Yourself

1. Connect your device to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided code.
3. Ensure the Board tutorial from M5 and `Adafruit_NeoPixel`, `ArduinoJson`, `ESPping`, `IniFile`, `M5GFX`, `M5Unified`, `TinyGPSPlus`, and `esp8266audio` libraries are installed. Follow these tutorials for guidance on M5 Board tutorial:
   - [Arduino Board Setup](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_board)
   - [Arduino Library Installation](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_library)
4. Ensure the ESP32 and M5Stack board definitions are installed. **Note:** Errors occur with ESP32 version `3.0.0-alpha3` for no M5stack devices. Please use M5stack board with ESP32 version `2.1.4` and below.
5. Place the necessary SD file content at the root of SD card. (This is needed to access the `IMG` startup and `sites` folder). ⚠️ the SD-Card-Folder files now need to be in a folder named evil at root of the sd card ⚠️
6. (Optional) Edit theme.ini on the SD card to customize your device's color theme. (Only supported for cardputer, other devices to be implemented later)
7. Ensure to run the script in `utilities/deauth_prerequisites` to bypass the ESP32 firmware.
8. Add libraries for BadUSB functionality. See `utilities/Bad_Usb_Lib/README.md`
9. Ensure that the baud rate is set to `115200`.
10. Ensure that `PSRAM` is disabled in the tools menu.
11. Upload the script to your M5Core2 device.
12. Restart the device if needed.

**Warning**: for Cardputer you need to change the Flash size to 8MB and the Partition Scheme to 8M with spiffs (3MB APP/1.5MB SPIFFS) or space error may occur.  
It's your first time with arduino IDE or something not working correctly? You should check out video section or ask help on the discord!

## ESP32 Rig Slave

### You can use any ESP32 as slave to collect SSID for wigle and sniff EAPOL

By using 14 ESP32 devices, you can monitor all 14 Wi-Fi channels on the 2.4GHz band simultaneously without channel hopping. The **Cardputer** uses GPS to link each received SSID to a CSV file compatible with Wigle.

This slave code is designed to run on any ESP32 and use it as a slave for wardriving in combination with the wardriving master mode on **Cardputer**.  
Each ESP32 collects SSIDs of nearby access points (APs) on a specific channel or can hop between configured channels.  
You can add multiple ESP32 devices to improve the accuracy and strength of the scan. Devices with external antennas can enhance performance for wardriving.

### Tested on:

- **AtomS3**: [Buy here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnDXSKJ)
- **AtomS3 Lite**: [Buy here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dm0e95D)
- **ESP32-C3** (with external antenna): [Buy here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DD1yibp) (Be careful to select sets WITH antenna)
- **WEMOS D1 Mini**: [Buy here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEWPrnz)
- **ESP32 C5**: [Buy here](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005009128201189.html)

### Features:

- **Multi-Device Support**: Add any number of ESP32 devices to increase AP detection and improve coverage.
- **Channel Hopping**: Configure the ESP32 to scan on a specific channel or hop between selected channels.
- **Better Signal Strength**: ESP32 devices with external antennas provide improved signal capture for long-range wardriving.
- **Master-Slave Communication**: Use in combination with the **Cardputer** in wardriving master mode to aggregate and monitor data from multiple ESP32 slaves.
- **GPS Integration**: The **Cardputer** with GPS link SSID data with geographic coordinates and generate Wigle-compatible CSV files.

### How it Works:

1. Deploy one or more ESP32 devices in slave mode.
2. Each device scans and captures SSID information on designated channels.
3. The data is sent to the **Evil**, which aggregates it and reduces missed APs while improving overall scan accuracy and signal strength.

### Hardware Requirements:

- Evil with v1.3.0
- ESP32 devices (e.g., AtomS3, AtomS3 Lite, ESP32-C3, WEMOS D1 Mini)
- External antenna (optional, for enhanced performance)

Here an assembly with 8 esp32-c3 connected in parallel and which scans 1,3,6,9,11,13 in static mode and in hopping for 2 others on 2,4,5,7 and 8,10,12,14:
